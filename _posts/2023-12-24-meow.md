[**Meow**](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point) is one of the Starting Points from [**HackTheBox**](https://app.hackthebox.com/), where in CTF Meow we will learn about **Telnet**.

## Introduction

- Connect **Meow** using **Pwnbox** or **OpenVPN**.
- Spawn machine.

## Enumeration

To check the target connection and port, we can use **Ping** and **Nmap**.

### Ping

After connect with Meow, then `ping` Target IP.

```bash
❯ ping 10.129.49.190

PING 10.129.49.190 (10.129.49.190) 56(84) bytes of data.

```

### Nmap

Scan all open port of target with `nmap`, `-sCV` is a combination of `-sC` and `-sV`, where `-sC` displays the script for the port and `-sV` displays the version info for the port. 

```bash
❯ nmap -sCV 10.129.49.190

Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-12-24 07:18 WIB
Nmap scan report for JSN.JaringanKU (10.129.49.190)
Host is up (1.2s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
23/tcp open  telnet  Linux telnetd

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 170.93 seconds
```

You can see that the open port at `23/tcp` is for the **Telnet** service.

```bash
❯ telnet 10.129.49.190

Once we get into Telnet from the target, let's look for the flag.

```bash
root@Meow:~# ls
flag.txt  snap

root@Meow:~# cat flag.txt
