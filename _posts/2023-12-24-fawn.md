[**Fawn**](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point) is one of the Starting Points from [**HackTheBox**](https://app.hackthebox.com/), where in CTF Fawn we will learn about **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**.

## Introduction

- Connect **Fawn** using **Pwnbox** or **OpenVPN**.
- Spawn machine.

## Reconnaissance

To check the target connection and port, we can use **Ping** and **Nmap**.

### Ping

After spawn machine, we can start with ping Target IP.

```bash
❯ ping 10.129.137.216

PING 10.129.137.216 (10.129.137.216) 56(84) bytes of data.

```

### Nmap

To be able to see all open ports, we can use `Nmap`, `-sCV` is a combination of `-sC` and `-sV`, where `-sC` displays the script for the port and `-sV` displays the version info for the port. 

```bash
❯ nmap -sCV 10.129.137.216

## Foothold

OK, you can see the open port 21/tcp which is the FTP service. We can generally connect to FTP by using the username `anonymous` and without using a password.

### FTP

```bash
❯ ftp 10.129.137.216

Connected to 10.129.137.216.

```

After downloading the file, exit FTP and check your working directory.

```bash
❯ ls
 flag.txt

❯ cat flag.txt
