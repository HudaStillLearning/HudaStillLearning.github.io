[**Responder**](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point) is one of the Starting Points from [**HackTheBox**](https://app.hackthebox.com/), where in CTF Responder we will learn about **??**.

## Introduction

- Connect **Responder** using **Pwnbox** or **OpenVPN**.
- Spawn machine.

## Enumeration

To check the target connection and port, we can use **Ping** and **Nmap**.

### Ping

After spawn machine, we can start with `ping` Target IP.

```bash
‚ùØ ping 10.129.110.220

PING 10.129.110.220 (10.129.110.220) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.129.110.220: icmp_seq=1 ttl=127 time=289 ms
64 bytes from 10.129.110.220: icmp_seq=2 ttl=127 time=412 ms
64 bytes from 10.129.110.220: icmp_seq=3 ttl=127 time=424 ms
64 bytes from 10.129.110.220: icmp_seq=4 ttl=127 time=255 ms

```

### Nmap

Scan ports using `nmap`, `-p-` to scan all ports, `-sV` to display port version info, `-T4` to speed up scanning (the higher the faster [0-5]).

```bash

```
